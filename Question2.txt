OS Assignment 2

Question 2:-
1.Here, we have written a custom command in syscall_64.tbl.
2.After this,I have made a file that contains a function to copy a 2D array and it does the said job using a syscall which calls the implemented syscall from kernel.
3.The syscall is implemented using copy_from_user() and copy_to_user().
4.Then, I have generated a diff file which shows the kernel_2d_memcpy() only in the newly compiled kernel.
